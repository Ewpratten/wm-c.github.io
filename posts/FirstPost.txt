Welcome to my site, I'm William Meathrel and I'm currently a grade 12 attending school in London Ontario.
<br/>I've been programming for a couple years now, but I've only gotten serious with it in the last year or so.
<br/>At the moment I am the programming team lead for the [<a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5024">FRC team 5024</a>]{color: grey; text-decoration: underline;}
<br/>
<br/>[Anyways enough about me, lets talk about my website. When I first started making this site, I was already well aware that I sucked at designing things, however I feel as if I did a decent job on this site. When I was making this site I did a bit of hacky stuff as I don't have the proper equipment to make a functional backend. When you came to this blog you probably saw the links to diffrent posts. Thoses are generated by javascript from a file that is updated whenever I add new posts and push them. The pages are also made using a script I wrote instead of a django because github pages doesn't allow the use of django. Because of this I was planning on switching to Digital Oceans. I was doing some research on it and I feel like I should do it not only to improve my site but also for the learning experince. Anyway thanks for reading.]{max-width: 800px; display: inline-block;}
